The second assignment - https://www.gradescope.com/courses/358896/assignments/1796872 (Links to an external site.) - asks you to find the location in the genome that minimizes the skew.  The input  (called "input", as usual), contains just one string of DNA, which may occur across multiple lines. If there are ties, you must return all positions where the skew is minimized.

For more details, please see problem 1F in the textbook and http://rosalind.info/problems/ba1f/ (Links to an external site.) .

IMPORTANT: Deadlines for submission are maintained in ELMS, not Gradescope.  If you do not enter anything in ELMS, the assignment will not be marked as completed even if you do it correctly on time in Gradescope. More details are available here: Grading and deadlines. Note, that you can propose your own deadline if you think the one I provided is too tight.
