The second assignment - https://www.gradescope.com/courses/358896/assignments/1796872 (Links to an external site.) - asks you to find the location in the genome that minimizes the skew.  The input  (called "input", as usual), contains just one string of DNA, which may occur across multiple lines. If there are ties, you must return all positions where the skew is minimized.

For more details, please see problem 1F in the textbook and http://rosalind.info/problems/ba1f/ (Links to an external site.) .
